## Azimuthal equidistant map projection

The azimuthal equidistant map projection creates a map that puts points equidistant from the map's center in a circle surrounding it. It has the useful properties that all points on the map are at proportionately correct distances from the center point, and that all points on the map are at the correct azimuth (direction) from the center point. The most famous example is the flag of the United Nations which centers at the north pole. It is an interesting and complex projection that in the past was mainly used to create line drawings. Now, it can be done in realtime on a GPU in your web browser.

You can see an interactive map [here](http://rogerallen.github.io/webgl/2014/01/27/azimuthal-equidistant-projection/), use the mouse to move center of the map projection.
